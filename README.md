# Credit Card Validator 

Credit Card Validator Algorithm

## Description

In this exercise you must write a function that takes a string as input and returns true or false to verify if the input string is a valid credit card number.

The following criteria must be met to be a valid credit card number:

	* String must be between 13 and 19 characters long.
	* All characters in the string must be a number.
	* Starting at the last digit, every digit must be totaled with the exception that every other digit must be doubled. 
	If this doubled number is greater than 9 then the doubled number must be divided by 10 and the remainder must be added to the sum otherwise the original value is added to the sum.
	* The final sum must be divisible by 10.

## Objectives

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub profile and clone to your local machine.

2. Create a basic page layout via HTML/CSS with an input field and a submit button. 

3. Write a function that retrieves the input value and another function that is called to verify the input and return true or false to validate whether number is valid or not.

4. Show visual effect in response to whether the number is a valid credit card number.
